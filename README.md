# Introduction

**Hello Everyone!**

I just wanted to introduce myself since the Bio section has limited characters.
I'm a writer and film photographer currently taking an introductory web design course.
My goal is to expand my creative and technical skills by 
building and maintaining web pages to create new opportunities for myself in the digital world. 
I would like to build a new portfolio site for my photography and 
interactive sites for future films I work on, so I don't have to outsource the work. 
In doing so, I hope to gain the skills necessary to build websites for clients also working in the film industry.

I don't have web design skills to list *yet*, but I'm proficient with Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere!
